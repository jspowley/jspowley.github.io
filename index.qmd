## About

In 2022, I pivoted my career as a piano teacher to financial analytics. Today I develop the analytics skill-sets of teams and build the tools they need to succeed.

My previous projects grapple with complex data and problems, and range full full big data natural language processing models to highly detailed parameter optimization on trading strategies. I merge my prior experience as a teacher with skills in analytics to develop teams and build the tools needed grapple with big data in a complex world.
