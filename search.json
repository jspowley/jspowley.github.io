Such a workflow would allow for a filtered dataframe of endpoints to be immediately connverted into live links. Additional functionality would include functions for saving an endpoint image for stable continued use, and recursive metadata functions for identifying endpoint attributes, as well as merge functions for linking to bulk data downloads for lazy loading.\nA secondary level to this implementation could be an EIA data browser, through shiny as a package, to enable first layer EDA for data scientists."
